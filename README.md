Investigating the relation between observables and halo properties in LGalaxies

"plotting_observables" contains code to plot halo formation times predicted from individual parameters
"running_random_forests" runs random forests on several paramters to predict formation times and plots the output

"Data" would contain the catalogues used in the study. Queries used to get this data are stored in "queries.rtf"
